Learn more\n        \n        \n            ng add @nguniversal/express-engine\n            npm run build:ssr &amp;&amp; npm run serve:ssr\n        \n        \n            Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000/.\n        \n        Adding a service worker to your project - PWA\n        \n            To set up the Angular service worker in your project, use the CLI command ng add @angular/pwa. It takes care of configuring your app to use service workers by adding the service-worker package along with setting up the necessary support files.

First time you opens your site in browser it will asks you to save as PWA. If you click yes it installed in your mobile and it reacts like normal applicaton. This is pretty much and yeah its good but if you release any updates in your website it will not reflect in already installed application right?. No problem.

install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:\n\n# Install the Angular CLI globally\nnpm install -g @angular/cli\n\n# provide your project name instead waioz-angular-v9, as shown here\nng new waioz-angular-v9\nSet routing option yes.\nchoose your styling platform extension\n\nBrowser Support\n\ninstall web-animation-js for browser support. Old browsers does not support some features of Angular.\nLearn more\n# install the optional web animations polyfill\nnpm install --save web-animations-js\nYou can then add the import statement in the src/polyfills.ts\n\n\nServer Side Rendering (SSR) - Angular Universal\n\nTo create the server-side app module, app.server.module.ts, run the following CLI command.\n Learn moreng add @nguniversal/express-enginenpm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr\nOpen a browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000/.\n\nAdding a service worker to your project - PWA\n\nTo set up the Angular service worker in your project, use the CLI command ng add @angular/pwa. It takes care of configuring your app to use service workers by adding the service-worker package along with setting up the necessary support files. \nLearn more#ng add @angular/pwa --project *project-name*\nng add @angular/pwa --project waioz-angular-v9npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr\nOpen a browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000/.\nSo PWA creates the application in mobile phones. First time you opens your site in browser it will asks you to save as PWA. If you click yes\nit installed in your mobile and it reacts like normal applicaton. This is pretty much and yeah its good but if you release any updates in your website it will not reflect in already installed application right?. No problem. Here is the solution for that \"Service worker communication\"\nLearn more\n\nBootstrap\n\nAdd bootstrap in your projectnpm install bootstrap --save\n\n\n#add this line in style.css\n@import \"~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css\";\n\n### Lazy Loading Modules\n* First prepare your module structure based on your project requirement and page routing\n```bash\n#http://domain/{route}\n#                  {modulename}     {route path}  {parent module}\nng generate module homepage --route home --module app.module\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2020 waioz\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
